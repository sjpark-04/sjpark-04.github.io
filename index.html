      <h2>Humaster</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">During my Summer 2025 internship at Humaster, I supported senior engineers across multiple projects, contributing to technical problem-solving and project execution. The work below highlights key initiatives I was involved in during this placement.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">Automatic Humidity Controller</h3>
      <p class="about-text">One project required a controlled temperature-humidity environment for laboratory experiments. With commercial environmental chambers exceeding budget, I designed and built an automated humidity control system integrated with heated storage, delivering a cost-effective solution that met experimental requirements.</p>
      <ul class="subsection-list">
        <li>Designed a microcontroller-based humidity regulation system using an Arduino platform communicating with a digital temperature-humidity sensor through MAX485 transceiver, relay-controlled humidifier, and LCD touchscreen interface. Assembled the hardware using PCB terminal blocks with structured wiring, insulation, and heat-shrink protection to ensure reliable connections and system maintainability.</li>
        <li>Developed embedded control logic in MicroPython, implementing a threshold-based on-off control algorithm that continuously monitored humidity levels and autonomously regulated humidifier operation to maintain stable environmental conditions for laboratory use.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="about-text">The system successfully maintained user-defined humidity setpoints within ±5% RH during heated storage validation, meeting performance specifications. Low-temperature testing (40–60°C) revealed transient overshoot typical of bang-bang control; however, under actual operating conditions (>80°C), the thermal environment naturally dampened the response, eliminating instability without requiring additional control tuning.</p>
      <p class="about-text key-skills"><strong>Key Skills:</strong> Arduino IDE, MicroPython programming, Electrical Wiring, Serial Communications</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">Hioki Data logger program</h3>
      <p class="about-text">During my internship, I worked with a Hioki data logger that measured multiple physical properties simultaneously but had significant limitations: all data was stored locally, and the device could only be controlled manually through physical buttons. I developed a USB-based program that enabled remote control, real-time visualization, and automatic data transfer to address these constraints.</p>
      <ul class="subsection-list">
        <li>Developed a Python application using PyQt6 and PyQtGraph for the custom GUI and real-time graphing capabilities, with PySerial enabling bidirectional serial communication for command transmission and data acquisition.</li>
        <li>Implemented the manufacturer's complete command protocol to enable full remote control of measurement operations and device configuration.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="about-text">The application successfully automated the entire workflow—from remote device configuration and real-time plotting to automatic Excel export upon measurement completion. This solution achieved a 60% reduction in working time, significantly improving data analysis and reporting efficiency.</p>

    <section id="mechathon" class="section">
      <h2>Mechathon</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">In January 2026, I participated in MES Mechathon, an Autodesk-powered engineering challenge where teams design and manufacture solutions within three days. The competition develops rapid prototyping skills, creative problem-solving, and teamwork under tight deadlines. This year's challenge: build a water-powered wheeled device that travels the furthest distance possible using only water propulsion.</p>
      <ul class="subsection-list">
        <li>Engineered a vehicle with a 0.8 m water column and designed a low-profile frame to stabilize the elevated center of mass while meeting strict dimensional constraints. The design balanced structural integrity with weight distribution to prevent tipping during operation.</li>
        <li>Developed a custom 3D-printed nozzle using CAD, optimized for compatibility with PVC water columns. Created a MATLAB program to calculate optimal nozzle inlet/outlet dimensions and water head height by predicting maximum travel distance and acceleration across varying parameter configurations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="about-text">Our team successfully built a water-propelled vehicle that traveled nearly 3 meters down the track. While the propulsion system performed well, the device stopped prematurely when the axle—which extended too far—collided with the track boundaries. This highlighted an important lesson: potential failure points must be identified and mitigated earlier in the design phase to ensure reliable performance under competition conditions.</p>
      <p class="about-text key-skills"><strong>Key Skills:</strong> CAD Design (Fusion 360), MATLAB programming, manual dexterity, creativity, critical thinking, problem solving, pressure handling, teamwork</p>

    <section id="uclr" class="section">
      <h2>UCLR (University College London Racing)</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">During my first year at UCL, I joined the UCLR Rover team as a design engineer. My role centered on redesigning and improving existing rover components to boost overall performance and efficiency.</p>
      <ul class="subsection-list">
        <li>Reduced rover wheel mass by 15.7% by redesigning the inflatable tire as a 3D-printable airless tire, validated through FEA simulations to meet full-load structural requirements.</li>
        <li>Designed rail-mounted battery enclosures tailored to the redesigned rover frame, enhancing power system protection and reliability in harsh operating conditions.</li>
        <li>Created a new sponsorship brochure featuring simplified design elements and Mars-themed visual identity to improve the team's sponsorship outreach and brand presentation.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="imeche" class="section">
      <h2>IMechE</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">In my first year of university, I participated in the 2023 IMechE Design Challenge. The task was to design and build an internal pipe climber that ascends a vertical pipe, reverses at the top, and stops at its starting position - all within a strict £50 budget.</p>
      <ul class="subsection-list">
        <li>Created detailed CAD models for design validation and feasibility analysis before proceeding to manufacturing.</li>
        <li>Built the complete device per design specifications, procuring all necessary components and tools while adhering to the £50 budget limit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="about-text">Our team successfully fabricated a device that matched the CAD design specifications. However, functionality issues emerged during testing - the climber failed to ascend due to dimensional mismatch between the pipe diameter and climber width. This highlighted the need for more rigorous physical prototyping and dimensional validation beyond CAD modeling to ensure real-world performance.</p>

    <section id="drone" class="section">
      <h2>Drone</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">I competed in the December 2025 Drone Sim Challenge, hosted by Royal Holloway's Robotics & AI Society. Teams had to develop an autonomous drone controller capable of identifying all targets, logging their coordinates within a 3D Webots arena, and navigating obstacle-free - all while minimizing completion time.</p>
      <ul class="subsection-list">
        <li>Implemented PID control algorithms in C to stabilize drone flight dynamics and improve maneuverability.</li>
        <li>Developed RGB color-based object detection using thresholding techniques in C to accurately identify all target objects.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="about-text">Our team placed 1st in the competition by demonstrating the most stable drone flight control among all participants, successfully detecting 2 out of 3 targets with accurate coordinate logging. While we missed one target, the superior flight stability and control precision proved decisive in securing the win.</p>
