      <h2>Humaster</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">During my Summer 2025 internship at Humaster, I supported senior engineers across multiple engineering initiatives, contributing to technical tasks, problem-solving, and project execution. The projects below highlight the key work I was involved in during this placement.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">Automatic Humidity Controller</h3>
      <p class="about-text">One project required a controlled temperature–humidity environment for laboratory experiments. With commercial environmental chambers exceeding the budget, I took the initiative to design and build an automated humidity control system integrated with heated storage, delivering a cost-effective in-house solution that met the experimental requirements.</p>
      <ul class="subsection-list">
        <li>Integrated a microcontroller-based humidity control system built around an Arduino platform with RS-485 communication via a MAX485 transceiver, incorporating a digital temperature–humidity sensor, relay-actuated humidifier control, and an LCD touch interface. The hardware architecture was assembled using PCB terminal blocks, structured wiring, insulation, and heat-shrink protection to ensure reliable electrical connections and maintainability.</li>
        <li>Developed the embedded control logic in MicroPython within the Arduino environment, implementing a threshold-based on–off control algorithm that continuously compared measured humidity against the setpoint and autonomously regulated humidifier power, achieving stable environmental control for laboratory operation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="about-text">The system was validated in heated storage trials, where the user-defined humidity setpoint—configured via the LCD touchscreen interface—was maintained within ±5% RH of target, satisfying the original performance specification. During low-temperature testing (40–60 °C), transient overshoot characteristic of bang–bang control was observed; however, under the actual operating condition (>80 °C), the thermal environment inherently damped the response, eliminating the instability without requiring further control tuning.</p>
      <p class="about-text key-skills"><strong>Key Skills:</strong> Arduino IDE, MicroPython programming, Electrical Wiring, Serial Communications</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">Hioki Data logger program</h3>
      <p class="about-text">During my internship, I worked with a Hioki data logger used to measure multiple physical properties simultaneously. The device stored all data locally and could only be operated manually through physical buttons, which limited efficiency and accessibility. To overcome these limitations, I developed a USB-based program featuring remote device control, real-time graph visualization, and automatic data transfer to a laptop.</p>
      <ul class="subsection-list">
        <li>Developed a Python-based application leveraging PyQt6 and PyQtGraph to create a custom GUI with real-time graphing capabilities and implemented PySerial for serial communication to transmit commands and receive measurement data from the device.</li>
        <li>Integrated the manufacturer's complete command protocol, allowing users to remotely start/stop measurements and modify all device settings.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="about-text">Delivered a fully functional application that streamlines the entire measurement workflow: remotely configuring device settings, initiating measurements with automatic real-time plotting, and stopping measurements with automatic Excel export to the laptop. This solution reduced working time by 60%, significantly accelerating data analysis and reporting.</p>
